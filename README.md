# Binary Search Tree (BST) — The Odin Project Assignment

This project is part of The Odin Project’s JavaScript Course under the Data Structures and Algorithms section. The goal is to build a fully functional Balanced Binary Search Tree, implement core BST operations, and understand recursion, traversal techniques, and time complexity.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this assignment, you will:
* Create a Node class storing:
    - data
    - left
    -  right

* Create a Tree class that:
    - Builds a balanced BST from an input array
    - Provides insertion and deletion operations
    - Supports searching and all tree traversals
    - Calculates a node’s height and depth
    - Checks whether the tree is balanced
    - Rebalances an unbalanced tree
You’ll also write a driver script (main.js) that tests all the features.
